# WPCP Transit Tracker
### By John Charles Falciglia (Juan Carlos Falciglia)
---------------------------------
Hi, welcome to the wpcp transit tracker/infromation system. This is a student devloped infromation system, and also a student developed readme.
This is for all yall future payton students, and is a guide on the infromation system, the software, what it runs on, how to modify it, rules and reg, ect.
## Purpose:
Develop a neater, more informative, more readable, and more space effiecent display for the screen in the center of the atrium
## The Software
This is a website , that pulls from a couple diffrent api's and displays the infromation
APIs: CTA Train Tracker, CTA Bus Tracker, CTA Customer Alerts, and a weather API.
It uses writen CSS, no externals like boot stramp, partially becuase I don't need animations and all that jazz
It also uses in line JS, to fetch data, and manipulate it to be displayed
## The Hardware
It runs on the Security Tv in the lobby, and it runs on a system called Airtame 2
Airtame 2 can display slides, youtube, websites and more, so if you want to switch it up latter on, feel free to
## How to modify
Edit the CSS file for decroative things, and edit the html file for posisitioning and also the JS
Be careful when modifiing however, as there are specific regulations you got to follow due to copywrite laws and stuff like that
## Rules and Reg
This is the really <b>IMPORTANT<b> stuff, so I suggest understanding this if you want to actually change stuff and not get in trouble
The CTA has certain rules and regulations on <b>Color<b>
When using the API, they want you to use the <b>Offical CTA Transit COLORS<b> so like red line red and brown line brown.
These colors are already the ones used, and if you think they look ugly, thats a you problem, and can't and won't be fixed
Arguably more important <b> NO CTA LOGO<b> you can't use any past present or future logo of the CTA, and doing so runs the line on a lot of legal issues
Next, the things that are along side both the Bus and Train sections are the offical Train and Bus Tracker Icon's respectively, which you <b>CAN USE, HOWEVER<b>
remember that while using it, you make sure that the full thing is visable and isn't obscured, I would recommend keeping it as it is, you can also remove it
if you want, but ethier way make sure that you follow all proper practice.
Also, this was a quick overview of rules and reg, look at this: https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/terms/ and https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/branding/
before proceeding
## Questions and Suggestions
Follow basic question ettiqute, if you just send an email to me and its asking about infromaiton that could be found here or somewhere I provided, I will not be happy
Your first stop for questions should be in the documentation
2nd, go to issues (however I highly doubt any highschooler will report an issue via github), but I will put past issues in the readme or smth
3rd, if its something dealing with the API and fetching the infromation, look at this: https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/
4th, email me, jcfalciglia@cps.edu (school) or falcigliajohn@gmail.com (personal/business) or linkjt9@gmail.com (busniess)
If you want to suggest something, I would prefer if you don't just tell me something that should happen, and rather learn just a bit about it
Then just shoot me an email @ the ones from above
Also if its Grammer just fix it, like no need to check with me, I know my spelling sucks
If you want to contribute to the code, contact me and also do ur nomral fork and such, I would rather have someone who is passonate about coding do this
than someone who is good at coding who just wants to put it on their resume
